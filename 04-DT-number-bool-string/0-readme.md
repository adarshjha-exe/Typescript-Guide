# 4. TypeScript Types: Understanding `number`, `string`, and `boolean`

- The focus is on the **number**, **string**, and **boolean** types

### 1. `number`

- Both JavaScript and TypeScript support the `number` type.
- Unlike some other languages which distinguish between integers, floats, and doubles, JavaScript (and TypeScript) uses a single `number` type for all numeric values.
- Example:

```ts
let age: number = 30;
let price: number = 12.5;
```

### 2. `string`

- Strings can be defined using single quotes, double quotes, or backticks (template literals).
- TypeScript supports all forms of string declarations found in JavaScript.
- Example:

```ts
let name: string = "Alice";
let greeting: string = `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

### 3. `boolean`
- Represents true or false values.
- Supported by both JavaScript and TypeScript.
- Example:
```ts
let isLoggedIn: boolean = true;
```
