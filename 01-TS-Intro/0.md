# 1. What is TypeScript Language and why should you use it in place of JavaScript

## Key Points

- **TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript:**  
  It was developed by Microsoft in 2012 and builds on JavaScript by adding extra features and advantages, especially around typing.

- **Not a separate programming language:**  
  TypeScript code is compiled into JavaScript, which is the only language browsers natively understand. You write TypeScript, then use a compiler to produce JavaScript.

- **Benefits for developers:**  
  TypeScript introduces *strongly typed* features, letting you specify types for function arguments and variables. This helps catch errors early and avoids runtime type problems that JavaScript doesn't always catch.

## Why Use TypeScript Instead of JavaScript?

- **Catch errors earlier** with compile-time type checking
- **Write more maintainable, readable code** by defining variable and function types
- **Modern frameworks (like Angular)** use TypeScript as their foundation
- **Combine the flexibility of JS with extra safety features**, making it easier for teams and individuals to write large-scale applications
